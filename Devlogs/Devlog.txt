- Which industry role(s) sound the best and/or worst to you? Are you even sure you want to work within the industry? 
What else would you be interested in doing? - Which role(s) was surprising, boring, easy, hard, cheap, expensive, or __? 


Many roles intrigued me in the reading. Some roles surprised me, such as audio engineer, which I never heard of. Since I am not settled yet on the decision between art and programming, roles in both appeal to me. Art-related roles such as concept artist, environment artist, fx artist, and sound designer, and programming-related roles such as gameplay programmer and AI programmer all sound interesting to me.

To be specific, I always heard about and liked the position of an art director, but just like many other roles in the reading, it probably sounds much simpler than it actually is. I am curious about the differences between the skill requirements for each, as many roles seem to be sharing a lot of common areas.

I'm also curious about the dynamics of these professions in the industry, such as which roles are the most popular, most needed, highest and lowest paid, and so on.Â
