Talk about your landscape game - what types of games come to mind? What can you do with what you have? Talk about your brainstorming process.

At first, I really wanted to make a platformer game, but because my college background has a 3d perspective, it would look strange to have 2d platforms in front. I had a hard time thinking of the mechanics and ended up choosing to make a bullet dodging game. This is a relatively easier choice, as I realize many other mechanics I thought of are too complicated, and I will face too many unknowns. Having a bullet drop from the ceiling also fits with the background, as the bullet can resemble the sunshine. To enhance that feeling, I added a trail to them. I am still thinking of what to add to make the game more unique and fit the background.
