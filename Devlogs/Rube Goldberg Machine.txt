Discuss your process of working on your Rube Goldberg machine!

To be honest, I expected the making of this assignment to be fun when I first heard about it, because I always find Rube Goldberg machines fascinating but never got a chance to make them. However, after trying to make it in Unity, I realized it's way more challenging than I expected. Tuning every object's mass, gravity, and position was time-consuming, as I needed to repeatedly play test in the game. What's more painful is the fact that for some reason, after changing a completely irrelevant object, my previous designed mechanics don't function properly anymore. This happened all the time, and so I had to remake the previous levels with tears. After all, however, I feel proud of my work, and it was satisfying to see everything (most things) running as I designed, and I think I learned a lot about the physics and camera of Unity.
