Discuss your process of working on your 2-week landscape game!
NEW: Write down 1 question you have about Unity or development in general (preferably nothing listed in the syllabus). This is an opportunity for you to request topics we may not cover by the end of class! *These questions do not count toward your 100 word minimum.

In the past two weeks, I have learned a lot about Unity by researching for codes that can implement the mechanics I wanted. In the past, I often borrowed codes without thoroughly understanding what each line did. This time, however, I understood most codes and was able to write a lot of them myself to achieve the design I wanted. For my project, there was a big change in the mechanism, from dodging bullets to delivering coffee. This design decision was made to fit the background theme better. It's also inspired by my daily experience of getting coffee from the station. Overall, though there were many failed attempts, I got most of what I wanted to implement into the game, and I enjoyed the process of making it.

Question: I'd like to hear about some coding tips and tricks for beginners. For example, in my project, I first referenced objects by using FindObjectWithTags, which was not very efficient, until I learned that you can use a static instance to make an object's variables accessible for all other scripts. I would like to know if there is any detailed advice on improving the efficiency of codes like this.
